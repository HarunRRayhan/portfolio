# Harun's Portfolio Deployment

This directory contains scripts and configuration for fully automated infrastructure provisioning and deployment of the Laravel portfolio application on AWS Lightsail, with Dockerized services and persistent PostgreSQL storage.

## Directory Structure

- `infra-create.sh` — Provisions infrastructure using Terraform, updates secrets, waits for SSH
- `infra-destroy.sh` — Destroys all provisioned infrastructure
- `deploy.sh` — Deploys the application, builds frontend, uploads assets, sets up Docker, runs migrations, and more
- `docker/` — Contains `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, and related files (now inside `deploy/`)
- `.env.deploy` — Deployment environment variables (merged into `.env` for deployment)
- `portfolio-key.pem` — SSH private key (auto-generated by infra-create.sh)

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI and credentials configured
- Terraform installed
- Node.js >= 18 and npm
- jq, zip, unzip, curl, and other common CLI tools

## Usage

### 1. Provision Infrastructure

```
cd deploy
./infra-create.sh
```
- This will run `terraform apply -auto-approve`, update `.env.deploy` with the new public IP, and write the SSH key to `portfolio-key.pem`.
- Wait for the script to finish and for SSH to become available (the script waits automatically).

### 2. Deploy the Application

```
./deploy.sh
```
- Builds frontend assets locally
- Uploads assets and code to the server
- Sets up Docker containers (app, db, nginx)
- Ensures PostgreSQL data is persisted via a Docker volume
- Waits for the database to be healthy before starting the app
- Runs Laravel migrations and caches
- Verifies DB connection from inside the app container
- Optionally purges Cloudflare CDN cache if configured

### 3. Destroy Infrastructure

```
./infra-destroy.sh
```
- Runs `terraform destroy -auto-approve` to tear down all resources

## Dockerized Database & Persistence
- The PostgreSQL database runs in a Docker container with a named volume (`postgres_data`) for persistent storage.
- Data is not lost when containers are recreated or the app is redeployed.

## Environment Variables
- `.env.deploy` is merged with `.env.example` and `.env.appprod` to generate the final `.env` used for deployment.
- Database credentials and other secrets are managed here.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see SSH or connection errors, ensure the Lightsail instance is up and the IP is correct in `.env.deploy`.
- If Docker Compose fails, check that the `docker/` directory is present inside `deploy/` and all paths are correct.
- For frontend build issues, ensure Node.js >= 18 is installed and available.
- For Cloudflare cache purge issues, ensure your API token and zone ID are correct in `.env.deploy`.

## Notes
- All scripts are idempotent and safe to re-run.
- The deployment script (`deploy.sh`) will fail and exit on any error.
- The app container will only start after the database is healthy.
- All logs are saved in `deploy/log/deploy.log`.
