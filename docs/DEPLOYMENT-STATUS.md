2. Daily certificate health checks
3. Automatic renewal when needed
4. S3 backup of all SSL data
5. Blue-green deployment SSL handling

## Emergency Procedures

If manual intervention is ever needed:

```bash
# Manual certificate renewal
./ssl-manager.sh renew

# Manual backup to S3
./ssl-manager.sh backup

# Check systemd timer status
systemctl status ssl-renewal.timer

# View renewal logs
journalctl -u ssl-renewal.service -f
```

## Summary

üéâ **SSL Certificate Management is now 100% automated!**

The system successfully handles the complete SSL certificate lifecycle without any manual intervention, from initial deployment through daily monitoring and renewal. All certificates are automatically backed up to S3, and the blue-green deployment process seamlessly integrates with SSL management.
